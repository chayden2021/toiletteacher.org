  { text: "Nothing has happened in the past; it happened in the Now. Nothing will ever happen in the future; it will happen in the Now.", citation: "The Power of Now" },
  { text: "Being is the eternal, ever-present One Life beyond the myriad forms of life that are subject to birth and death. However, being is not only beyond but also deep within every form as its innermost invisible and indestructible essence. But don't seek to grasp it with your mind. Don't try to understand it. You can know it only when the mind is still. When you are present, when your attention is fully and intensly in the Now, Being can be felt, but it can never be understood mentally. To regain awareness of Being and to abide in that state of feeling-realization is enlightenment.", citation: "The Power of Now" },
  { text: 'Love is not selective, just as the light of the sun is not selective. It does not make one person special. It is not exclusive. Exclusivity is not the love of God but the "love" of ego. However, the intensity with which true love is felt can vary. There may be one person who reflects your love back to you more clearly and more intensly than others, and if that person feels the same toward you, it can be said that you are in a love relationship with him or her. The bond that connects you with that person is the same bond that connects you with the person sitting next to you on a bus, or with a bird, a tree, a flower. Only the degree of intensity with which it is felt differs.', citation: "The Power of Now"},
  { text: "All cravings are the mind seeking salvation or fulfillment in external things... In that state, even my desire to become free or enlightened is just another craving for fulfillment or completion in the future. So don't seek to become free of desire or 'achieve' enlightenment. Become present... Instead of quoting the Buddha, be 'the awakened one', which is what the word buddha means.", citation: "The Power of Now" }, 
  { text: "So give up waiting as a state of mind. When you catch yourself slipping into waiting… snap out of it. Come into the present moment. Just be, and enjoy being. If you are present, there is never any need for you to wait for anything. So next time somebody says, \‘Sorry to have kept you waiting,\’ you can reply, \‘That\’s all right, I wasn\’t waiting. I was just standing here enjoying myself — in joy in my self.\’", citation: "The Power of Now", prompt: "Besides the toilet, of course, what are 5 common scenarios you could apply this to?"},
  { text: "All negativity is caused by an accumulation of psychological time and denial of the present. Unease, anxiety, tension, stress, worry - all forms of fear - are caused by too much future, and not enough presence. Guilt, regret, resentment, grievances, sadness, bitterness, and all forms of nonforgiveness are caused by too much past, and not enough presence.", citation: "The Power of Now" },
  { text: "It is not uncommon for people to spend their whole life waiting to start living.", citation: "The Power of Now" },
  { text: "As soon as you honor the present moment, all unhappiness and struggle dissolve, and life begins to flow with joy and ease. When you act out the present-moment awareness, whatever you do becomes imbued with a sense of quality, care, and love - even the most simple action.", citation: "The Power of Now" },
  { text: "Don't look for peace. Don't look for any other state than the one you are in now; otherwise, you will set up inner conflict and unconscious resistance. Forgive yourself for not being at peace. The moment you completely accept your non-peace, your non-peace becomes transmuted into peace. Anything you accept fully will get you there, will take you into peace. This is the miracle of surrender", citation: "The Power of Now" },
  { text: "Accept — then act. Whatever the present moment contains, accept it as if you had chosen it. Always work with it, not against it. Make it your friend and ally, not your enemy. This will miraculously transform your whole life.", citation: "The Power of Now" },
  { text: "Die to the past every moment. You don't need it. Only refer to it when it is absolutely relevant to the present. Feel the power of this moment and the fullness of Being. Feel your presence.", citation: "The Power of Now" },
  { text: "At the deepest level of Being, you are one with all that is", citation: "The Power of Now" },
  { text: "Thinking is only a small aspect of consciousness. Thought cannot exist without consciousness, but consciousness does not need thought", citation: "The Power of Now" },
  { text: "The more consciousness you direct into the inner body, the higher its vibrational frequency becomes, much like a light that grows brighter as you turn up the dimmer switch so as to increase the flow of electricity. At this higher energy level, negativity cannot affect you anymore, and you tend to attract new circumstances that reflect this higher frequency.", citation: "The Power of Now" },
  { text: "The moment you realize you are not present, you are present. Whenever you are able to observe your mind, you are no longer trapped in it. Another factor has come in, something that is not of the mind: the witnessing presence.", citation: "The Power of Now" },
  { text: "Stress is caused by being “here” but wanting to be “there,” or being in the present but wanting to be in the future.", citation: "The Power of Now" },
  { text: "In surrender, you no longer need ego defenses and false masks. You become very simple, very real. “That’s dangerous,” says the ego. “You’ll get hurt. You’ll become vulnerable.” What the ego doesn’t know, of course, is that only through the letting go of resistance, through becoming “vulnerable,” can you discover your true and essential invulnerability.", citation: "The Power of Now" },
  { text: 'So give up waiting as a state of mind. When you catch yourself slipping into waiting . . . snap out of it. Come into the present moment. Just be, and enjoy being. If you are present, there is never any need for you to wait for anything. So next time somebody says, “Sorry to have kept you waiting,” you can reply, "That\’s all right, I wasn\’t waiting."', citation: "The Power of Now" },
  { text: "[Presence]... It's not what you think it is!... Try a little experiment. Close your eyes and say to yourself: 'I wonder what my next thought is going to be.' Then become very alert and wait for the next thought. Be like a cat watching a mouse hole. What thought is going to come out of the mouse hole? Try it now.", citation: "The Power of Now" },
  { text: '\\i What do you mean by \'rooted within yourself\'?\\i\nIt means to inhabit your body fully. To always have some of your attention in the inner energy field of your body. To feel the body from within, so to speak. Body awareness keeps you present. It anchors you in the Now.', citation: "The Power of Now" },
  { text: "When there is no way out, there is still always a way through. So don’t turn away from the pain. Face it. Feel it fully. Feel it — don’t think about it! Express it if necessary, but don’t create a script in your mind around it. Give all your attention to the feeling, not to the person, event, or situation that seems to have caused it. Don’t let the mind use the pain to create a victim identity for yourself out of it. Feeling sorry for yourself and telling others your story will keep you stuck in suffering. Since it is impossible to get away from the feeling, the only possibility of change is to move into it; otherwise, nothing will shift. So give your complete attention to what you feel, and refrain from mentally labeling it. As you go into the feeling, be intensely alert. At first, it may seem like a dark and terrifying place, and when the urge to turn away from it comes, observe it but don’t act on it. Keep putting your attention on the pain, keep feeling the grief, the fear, the dread, the loneliness, whatever it is. Stay alert, stay present — present with your whole Being, with every cell of your body. As you do so, you are bringing a light into this darkness. This is the flame of your consciousness.", citation: "The Power of Now" },
  { text: "Those who have not found their true wealth, which is the radiant joy of Being and the deep, unshakable peace that comes with it, are beggars, even if they have great material wealth. They are looking outside for scraps of pleasure or fulfillment, for validation, security, or love, while they have a treasure within that not only includes all those things but is infinitely greater than anything the world can offer.", citation: "The Power of Now" },
  { text: "The moment that judgement stops through acceptance of what it is, you are free of the mind. You have made room for love, for joy, for peace.", citation: "Practicing the Power of Now" },
  { text: "Be where you are. Look around. Just look, don't interpret. See the light, shapes, colors, textures. Be aware of the silent presence of each thing. Be aware of the space that allows everything to be.", citation: "Practicing the Power of Now" },
  { text: "If you cannot be at ease with yourself when you are alone, you will seek a relationship to cover up your unease. You can be sure that the unease will then reappear in some other form within the relationship, and you will probably hold your partner responsible for it. All you really need to do is accept this moment fully. You are then at ease in the here and now and at ease with yourself.", citation: "The Power of Now" },
  { text: "When you surrender to what is and so become fully present, the past ceases to have any power. The realm of Being, which had been obscured by the mind, then opens up. Suddenly, a great stillness arises within you, an unfathomable sense of peace. And within that peace, there is great joy. And within that joy, there is love. And at the innermost core, there is the sacred, the immeasurable, That which cannot be named.", citation: "Practicing the Power of Now" },
  { text: "\\iIs there a difference between happiness and inner peace?\\i\nYes. Happiness depends on conditions being perceived as positive; inner peace does not... Seen from a higher perspective, conditions... are neither positive nor negative. They are as they are. And when you live in complete acceptance of what is - which is the only sane way to live - there is no 'good' or 'bad' in your life anymore.", citation: "The Power of Now" },
  { text: "Never personalize Christ. Don't make Christ into a form identity. Avatars, divine mothers, enlightened masters, the very few that are real, are not special as persons. Without a false self to uphold, defend, and feed, they are more simple, more ordinary than the ordinary man or woman. Anyone with a strong ego would regard them as insignificant or, more likely, not see them at all. If you are drawn to an enlightened teacher, it is because there is already enough presence in you to recognize presence in another.", citation: "The Power of Now" },
  { text: "The feeling of your inner body is formless, limitless, and unfathomable. You can always go into it more deeply. If you cannot feel very much at this stage, pay attention to whatever you \\ican\\i feel. Perhaps there is just a slight tingling in your hands or feet. That's good enough for the moment. Just focus on the feeling. Your body is coming alive.", citation: "The Power of Now" },
  { text: "Whenever an answer, a solution, or a creative idea is needed, stop thinking for a moment by focusing attention on your inner energy field. Become aware of the stillness. When you resume thinking, it will be fresh and creative.", citation: "The Power of Now" },
